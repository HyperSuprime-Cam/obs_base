DM-7049 is an attempt to make the paf/yaml items consistent across mappers
by moving some entries to daf_butlerUtils using the latest HscMapper as a model.
Items were moved (M) to datasets.yaml and exposures.yaml. Some were also determined
to be obsolete (O) and removed from all of the mappers. The moved items were removed
from the HscMapper.paf file, but not the others.

Further work is needed, as described in this RFC, to bring all the mappers into
a consistent state.

1.  Datasets should have been moved (M), but retain a different definition in the
    mapper, because they differ from exposures.yaml or datasets.yaml.
    These are marked with M!.
 
2.  Data sets which appear in the mapper but not in HscMapper should be examined
    to see if they should be deleted or altered.

    These could be datasets which are unique to this mapper.
    They could also be datasets which are not longer in use.
    If they are neither, they are candidates for a name change.

3.  Number of datasets which appear in HSC but not in the mapper are not listed.
    They were not moved to daf_butlerUtils, so presumably are not targets for this
    round of changes.

4.  Datasets which share names with an HSC dataset but are not in butlerUtils.
    They marked with X!, P!, T!, S! or x! to show how they differ.

    These are not targets for this round of changes.

    They are listed in case there is some reason to either move them or make
    them consistent with HSC.

Other notes:

megacamMapper and suprimecamMapper contain bypass case for StackExposureId[_bits]
which now may be outmoded.

Many mappers constain a set of keys called "goodSeeingDiff" which do not appear to
be used.
